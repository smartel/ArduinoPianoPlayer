Checklist of steps to take if the .alc output doesn't sound right, because I'm sure I might forget a step at some point.
1. Try changing the bpm multiplier within the NoteTransposer
2. Are there multiple voices OR PARTS?
	a. If there are too many voices, such as a piano, a drum, a bass, ... then it may sound weird when all are converted to piano
	b. Try to see if there are multiple parts in the song. We fixed a bug earlier today (3-25-2019) where parts weren't merging successfully. Since we only have so many song examples, still a bit worried.
3. NoteTransposer has a few remaining TODO's still, such as REPEAT BARS.
4. Sometimes it really just is bad SOURCE data. The NoteTransposer was inserting some notes with 0 durations while translating a musicxml I grabbed from a website, and it turned out to be because the <duration> element was missing inside those <note>s. No, really.
