Checklist of steps to take if the .alc output doesn't sound right, because I'm sure I might forget a step at some point.
1. Try changing the bpm multiplier within the NoteTransposer
2. Are there multiple voices OR PARTS?
	a. If there are too many voices, such as a piano, a drum, a bass, ... then it may sound weird when all are converted to piano
	b. Try to see if there are multiple parts in the song. We fixed a bug earlier today (3-25-2019) where parts weren't merging successfully. Since we only have so many song examples, still a bit worried.
3. Are there Repeat Bars? That was one of the last features implemented and is a bit complicated, PARTICULARLY IF IT HAS BRANCHING ENDINGS. Apparently some real-life sheet music can have nested repeats, but it is not common, and some programs such as Finale can't even handle it, unless it is music21. Are there multiple branching endings (2 or more for a given repeat bar)?
4. Sometimes it really just is bad SOURCE data. The NoteTransposer was inserting some notes with 0 durations while translating a musicxml I grabbed from a website, and it turned out to be because the <duration> element was missing inside those <note>s. No, really.
5. Having trouble trying to get the bpm right? Could tweak bpm modifier to try getting the alc's runtime to match the song's runtime
