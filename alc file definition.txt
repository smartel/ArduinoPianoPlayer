ALC FILE DEFINITION
While this file isn't exactly meant to be human readable, it is not serialized.
Values are stored as whitespace-delimited tokens, and their location in the file matters.

THE FIRST LINE of an alc file is purely informational, and may contain the song name, artist name, transcriber name, and so on. Internal processes / the String tokenizer will completely ignore this line.

THE SECOND LINE of an alc file contains the number of note objects within the file, as a rudimentary integrity check.
When an alc file is read in, if a mismatch is noticed between the number of notes generated versus the expected number of notes per the header line count, it will produce a warning or error
that the file may be damaged.
	1. Note count
	
ALL FOLLOWING LINES of an alc file represent individual music notes each (so a chord takes multiple lines), in the order they are meant to be played
(the "start time" increases as you go down the lines - if the start time is the same on multiple lines, it means they are all played simultaneously):
	1. start time to play the note (in milliseconds), integer
	2. "compare value" of a note (NoteUtils takes the note's letter, octave, and whether it is sharp or flat, and converts it into a single number representing which key to hit), double
		NOTE: A rest will have a compare value of 0, as it has no letter, octave, or sharp/flat values.
	3. duration to play the note for (in milliseconds), integer
