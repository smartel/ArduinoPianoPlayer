	// This file will contain piano properties (such as how many keys are on the piano, what its first key is, and so on)
		// how many white keys
		// how many black keys
		// those can be combined to get total number of keys
		// should also be able to determine the number of octaves
		// WHAT IS THE FIRST KEY ON THE LEFT? For example, mine starts on E, so an A-D on the first octave wouldn't be possible on my piano.
		// I guess we should ask what the last key is too. For example, mine ends on a G.
	
		// Voice (for PianoFeigner use only)
	
	// This file will also contain arduino properties (such as how many fingers there are)
	
	// I don't think these properties need to be broken up into 2 separate files (one for piano, one for arduino), since they are both strongly hardcoded to one specific user's environment,
	// and I don't see myself making a separate fingered arduino or buying another piano/keyboard anytime soon. And worst case, that just results in copy-pasting the existing
	// properties file into a new file, and overwriting the values in one of them with the new values.
