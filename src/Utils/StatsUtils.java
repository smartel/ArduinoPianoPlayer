	// TODO
	// Name TBD.
	// Idea is to determine what keys are hit most often in a song, as well as the lowest note and the highest note in the song.
	//   May help with preparing where to place fingers. at least at the start of the song?
	// Additionally, can get some other details like >most simultaneous notes hit at a given point in the song, which will set a baseline for a minimum of how many fingers we need.

	// so:
	// Most popular notes (may be tied?)
	// Least popular notes (do we care??)
	// Highest note hit
	// Lowest note hit
	// Most simultaneous notes at a given time (aka minimum number of fingers needed)
