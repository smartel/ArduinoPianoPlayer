PianoFeigner:
	1. Note wav files only have 1 duration, and the sound is not stretched or shrunk in relation to the note it is representing.
	2. When displaying letters on keys, the gui hangs and won't play sound files or respond to hitting the X button to close.
		This option has temporarily been disabled.

MusicXml translation:
	1. Double flats and double sharps (alter element values greater than 1) not yet implemented
	2. Some musicxml DTD's give me a 403 error, until I remove the reference at the top of the musicxml. Then I can process it.
	3. Sometimes there are entities that fail to resolve, such as "&auml" (any entity like &___), until I remove them from the xml via find and replace all.

Unimplemented features:
	1. "Sliding fingers" for both arduino code generation, and how to physically move them with the arduino at a fast enough rate to play reasonably
	2. Midi file translation
